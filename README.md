I remember when 40rmie LX came out and I said "I don't need that, I have my 60+ percent boards to use for gaming." That was a mistake. 

I used the dimensions from Jake @ P3DStore's acrylic case to make the top case cutouts. I originally made this as close to LX as I could, then have simplified it for easier printing. I would suggest printing the top face down with a textured print bed. 

Assembly:
This case has holes for 20 m2 style bolts. Not all are required, the case does want at least 3 on the top and bottom, and 2 on each side. The combination doesn't matter. 
Accent layer currently just rests on top of the pcb, squished between pcb and top. 
I used 1x5mm foam gasket tape to mount the pcb and prevent rattling. You can either apply this directly to the pcb, or put on the top and bottom case sections where the pcb touches. 

plans:
-add recess for laser cut weight
-revamp mounting for top accent
